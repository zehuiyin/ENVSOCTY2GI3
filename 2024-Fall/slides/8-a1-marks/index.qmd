## Suspected AI Usage

- I do **not** use any AI checkers during marking.
  - I am aware that they are unreliable at this point.
- All cases were manually checked by me.
  - It is quite obvious when you discuss topics not covered in class (that you don’t really understand).
- All suspected cases were forwarded to the professor.
  - I am **not** the sole person making the call.
- If this happens, you need to <u>contact the professor</u> to discuss the suspect answers.

## Grade Appeal

- You can come to me if you need more explanation on why certain marks were deducted.
- My grading is fast, and feedback was short due to time constraints.
- Resubmission is **not** allowed.
  - This would be unfair to other students who adhered to the deadlines.
  - I will **not** respond to such request emails.
- Unless there is an error in my mark deduction, it is unlikely that marks will be adjusted.

## Suggestions for Future Assignments

- Ensure you submit everything in the final submission.
- Follow the instructions closely.
- Pay attention to how many marks are allocated to each question.
  - Spend extra time on high-stakes questions like short answers and maps.
