## Screenshots

- For your assignments, you will need to provide some screenshots.
- While you might consider using your phone to take a photo of your computer screen, this is not the recommended method.
  - Taking a photo of your screen can lead to _poor_ image quality and readability issues.
  - __Unprofessional!__

## How to Take a Screenshot?

- Click on the `Search` tab in the Taskbar.
- Type `Snipping Tool` in the search bar.
- In the Snipping Tool window, click on the `New` button to start capturing a screenshot.
- Drag your mouse to select the area you want to capture (the default mode is rectangular).
- Finally, save the screenshot by clicking the `Save As` button or copy it by clicking the `Copy` button.
