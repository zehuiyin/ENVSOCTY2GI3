## Assignment 5 Overview

- You will examine crimes in Toronto using open data from Ontario and the City of Toronto.
- You will learn:
  - How to use the interactive query builder (`Select By Attributes`) to construct SQL queries in ArcGIS Pro.
  - How to create buffers in ArcGIS Pro.
  - How to clip a layer in ArcGIS Pro.
  - How to remove duplicate records in a feature layer in ArcGIS Pro.

## Submission Details

- This is a <u>Connect Assignment</u>.
- You will submit everything on Connect.
- The deadline is 2:00 PM on **November 19**.
- Direct all extension requests to the professor.
- If you seek an accommodation (extension), you **must** save copies of your answers (e.g., save all your answers in a Word document). Your assignments will be reset with a new deadline, and the existing answers will be cleared.

## `Select By Attributes` Tool

:::

You can find the `Select By Attributes` tool in the attribute table of a specific feature layer.

Note that you should click the tool button in the feature layer that you want to subset or select. Otherwise, you will need to manually adjust the `Input Rows`.

## SQL Expression

![](./select_attribute3.png){height=250px}
:::

After you interactively constructed the query, you can access the corresponding SQL expression by turning on the SQL mode.

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language used to manage data in a relational database management system.

## Buffer

:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](./buffer.png){height=280px}
:::

The black geometries are buffered, resulting in the orange geometries.

The green lines represent equal distances.

## Clip

:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](./clip.png){height=280px}
:::

The orange circle is clipped by the black circle.

The orange geometry is then modified.
