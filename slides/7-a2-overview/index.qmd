  - No need to create a PDF for submission this time.

## Assignment 1 Marking

- Only the __latest__ submission will be marked.
  - No need to notify me about multiple submissions.
- A brief explanation will be provided for each mark deducted.
- Marks will be released after the professorâ€™s review.

## Assignment 1 Grade Appeal

- If you have concerns about your mark, feel free to __email__ me ([yinz39@mcmaster.ca](mailto:yinz39@mcmaster.ca)) to discuss.
  - Use the email subject: _ENVSOCTY 2GI3 Assignment 1 Appeal_
- Partial marks will be awarded where applicable.
