## Table Join

- Simple one-to-one join:
  - We have two (attribute) tables with the same number of rows.
    - These can be attribute tables from a feature layer or standalone (non-spatial) tables.
  - Both tables have a common key column containing IDs for each record.
  - Each unique ID in the left table corresponds one-to-one with a record in the right table.
