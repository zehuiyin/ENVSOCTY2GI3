## What is a Shapefile

- A geospatial *vector* data format.
- Developed and regulated by *Esri* as a mostly open specification.
- First introduced in the early 1990s.
- It consists of <u>a series of files</u> with the same name stored in the same directory.
  - Unlike a Word document, which is a single file per document.

## Shapefile Structure

- It has three mandatory files:
  - `.shp`: Shape format, contains the feature geometry.
  - `.shx`: Shape index format, a positional index of the feature geometry allowing quick seeking.
  - `.dbf`: Attribute format, contains columnar attributes for each shape, in dBase IV format.
  
## Shapefile Structure

- Other optional files:
  - `.prj`: Projection description
    - Although optional, a shapefile without a projection file cannot be displayed correctly in GIS software.
    - You will work with a shapefile without a projection file in assignment 3.
  - `.sbn`, `.sbx`, ...

## Modern Alternatives

GeoPackage:

- Uses the `.gpkg` extension.
- An open, non-proprietary, platform-independent, and standards-based data format for GIS.
- Based on SQLite.
- Can hold multiple vector and raster data layers in a single file.
- Initially released in 2014.
